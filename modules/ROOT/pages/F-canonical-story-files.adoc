= Appendix F. Canonical Story Files

image::iconaf.gif[]

Story files are mechanically best identified by their release number and serial code, which are written into the header information at the bottom of Z-machine memory. The release number can be anything between 0 and 65535 but is usually between 1 and 100. The serial code can consist of any six textual characters but is usually the date of compilation, arranged `*YYMMDD*`: thus 970619 refers to June 19th, 1997. The notation

*_Release number_._Serial code_*

identifies particular story files: for example the first production copy of _Enchanter_ is 10.830810.

Paul David Doherty’s investigations into Infocom’s released games have resulted in the following list of all known story files compiled by Zilch, the Infocom compiler:

Note that the two samplers and the mini-Zork are in the public domain and may be downloaded from Internet archive sites. One form of _Zork I_ can be downloaded freely from Activision’s Web pages promoting the Zork brand name.

The two problem children here are _Seastalker_, a submarine game which produces a sonar display across the top of the screen (and thus needs more sophisticated screen control features than the other Version 3 games) and _The Lurking Horror_, which uses sound effects (hence the “(s)” notation).

| _Beyond Zork_                              | 47.870915, 49.870917, 51.870923, 57.871221

| _Zork I_ SG                                | 52.871125
| _Zork I_ German                            | 3.880113 (beta)

The “SG” games were “solid gold” revisions of existing Version 3 games, adding on-line hints and an UNDO command. Regrettably these are not the versions distributed by Activision on their recent re-releases of the Infocom back catalogue.

One form of _Sherlock_ uses sound effects. _Border Zone_ introduces timed input. _Beyond Zork_ features a character-graphics font. But the most interesting file is the German translation of _Zork I_, which was never commercially released, introducing an alphabet table to the format.

.Version 6 story files
[%autowidth, cols="1,1,1,1,1" frame=none, grid=rows]

| Game        | Mac        | Amiga         | Apple II    | IBM

| _Arthur_    | 54.890606  | _same as Mac_ | 63.890622?  | 74.890714
| _Journey_   | 26.890316  | 30.890322     | 77.890616?  | 83.890706
| _Shogun_    | 292.890314 | 295.890321    | 311.890510? | 322.890706
| _Zork Zero_ | 296.881019 | 366.890323    | 383.890602? | 393.890714

The rule that story files should be independent of their target computers was dropped for Version 6 games and this leads to copious footnotes and exceptions in sections 8.8 and 16 of the standard. Story files for a particular game are substantially similar to each other but use fonts, pictures and so on slightly differently.

***

Note that a new Infocom game, _Zork: The Undiscovered Underground_ was published by Activision in 1997. 16.970828 is the only public version I know of: however, note that this file was compiled by Inform and not by Zilch. It is therefore not useful as a witness to Z-machine rules.
